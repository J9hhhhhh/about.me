      <p id="three">I loved you until you try get in my head</p>
      <p>And that's where I lost respect</p>
      <p>You're doing the most to get my attention, baby, I'm not impressed</p>
      <p>I changed my bed sheets, but I still smell your flesh</p>
      <p>I don't know how we got in this mess</p>

        This girl make me feel like less of a man 'cause I'm feeling depressed

      <p>Can't believe I was willing to drop everyone and invest in us</p>

      <p>Baby, you don't know what you're missing</p>
      <p>Our chemistry felt like quantum physics, physics</p>
      <p>Feeling your energy feeling your spirit</p>
      <p>If this is the end I need one more visit</p>

      <p id="six">They're showing me love, but I still feel empty</p>
      <p>I need something a lot more fulfilling, uh</p>
      <p>Move out of London Town then move to a rural village</p>
      <p>You made me delete that pic off my phone</p>
      <p>But I close my eyes, still see that image</p>
      <p>Won't chase if my heart ain't in it, it's finished</p>
